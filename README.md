Clients Project 
===============================
This is full beta project for me and my learning Java Enterprise, web etc.

Note 1: this is full beta (alpha) :-) project. Something can not work (for now its - image uploaded, but cannot read after it), something is broken, some code is indian.

Note 2: If you wanna use this for u (i do not recommend this) change the path to save in web.xml, and download this pack of images for populate.DB work correctly

Note 3: this is project to store clients in database, some info about them and images, also support opportunity to add images. 
Images stores in hard drive and path is hardcoded in web.xml. In database stores only name of images.

Note 4: Im trying to populate my DB using blob in java and bytea in PostgreSQL, (inside project by sql script). But not find a solution. If some1 can advice me how to do this, would be nice

features i want to add: validation, more tests, profiles of db(also store images in db, not only paths), and fix current problems.

In this project i used: Spring MVC, Spring JDBC, Spring Context, PostgreSQL, and a bit of Junit
